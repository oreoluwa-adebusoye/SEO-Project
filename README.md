# LinkUp
*Connecting people through shared events and meaningful interactions.*

## Overview
LinkUp is a social networking web app designed to help people connect through events. Users can browse upcoming activities, RSVP, chat with others, and discover potential friends with similar interests.
Our goal was to take social interaction **off of traditional social media** and into **real-life, in-person connections**.  
Our platform encourages people to meet around shared experiences and events, fostering authentic, lasting relationships beyond the screen.

## Features

- **User Profiles** – Create and customize your profile, including bio, interests, and upcoming events you’re attending.  
- **Event Discovery** – Browse and search for events with activities and locations of choice.  
- **RSVP System** – Indicate which events you plan to attend and see who else is going.  
- **Messaging** – Start conversations with other users, view chat history, and see unread message notifications.  
- **Navigation Links** – Quick access to Profile, Events, Messages, and more from the homepage.  

## Tech Stack
